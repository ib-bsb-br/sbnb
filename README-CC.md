# Confidential Computing Virtual Machine on Sbnb Linux

## Overview

This guide explains how to start a Virtual Machine (VM) in Confidential Computing (CC) mode using AMD SEV-SNP technology, available from AMD Epyc Gen 3 CPUs onwards.

Confidential Computing encrypts the memory and CPU states of the virtual machine, transforming it into a secure "black box". This setup allows workloads with sensitive data to operate securely, even in shared or untrusted environments.

## Prerequisites

- **Bare Metal Server** with **AMD SEV-SNP** support enabled in BIOS.
    - For example, take a look at this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hmnnwg/built_a_powerful_and_silent_amd_epyc_home_server/) where we built a powerful and quiet AMD EPYC 3rd Gen home server together with my kids.
- **Sbnb Linux Boot**:
    - Refer to the [README-INSTALL.md](README-INSTALL.md) for instructions on how to boot your server into Sbnb Linux.

## Step-by-step Guide

### 1. SSH into Bare Metal Server

Ensure your bare metal server is booted into Sbnb Linux and SSH into it using Tailscale.

```
ssh user@your-server-tailscale-name-or-ip
```

### 2. Confirm AMD SEV-SNP is Enabled

Run the following command to check SEV-SNP status:

```
sevctl ok
```

![sevctl: Confidential Computing (CC) SEV-SNP is enabled](images/sevctl.png)

If SEV-SNP is enabled, the command will show a `PASS` messages. Errors indicate missing BIOS configurations or unsupported CPU.

### 3. Run Docker Container with Required Tools

Launch a pre-built Docker container with SVSM, OVMF, and QEMU that supports AMD SEV-SNP:

```
docker run -it --privileged -v /dev/kvm:/dev/kvm -v /dev/sev:/dev/sev sbnb/svsm bash
```
Note: For those interested, here is a link to the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/sbnb-io/sbnb/blob/main/containers/svsm/Dockerfile) for exploration.
It is based on the official SVSM documentation. We created it to simplify the process of building Confidential Computing (CC) software.

### 4. Download Sbnb Linux Image

Download the Sbnb Linux `sbnb.raw` image from the official release page:

https://github.com/sbnb-io/sbnb/releases

### 5. Inject Tailscale Key into Image

Prepare the image by injecting your actual Tailscale key:

```
mkdir sbnb
mount -o offset=$((2048*512)) sbnb.raw sbnb
echo tskey-auth-YOUR-KEY > sbnb/sbnb-tskey.txt
umount sbnb
```

### 6. Start Confidential Computing VM

Set environment variables and start the VM:

```
export IGVM=/usr/qemu-svsm/coconut-qemu.igvm
export BOOT_IMAGE=sbnb.raw
export VCPU=16
export MEM=32G

/usr/qemu-svsm/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -enable-kvm \
  -cpu EPYC-Milan-v2 \
  -machine q35,confidential-guest-support=sev0,memory-backend=ram1,igvm-cfg=igvm0 \
  -object memory-backend-memfd,id=ram1,size=${MEM},share=true,prealloc=false,reserve=false \
  -object sev-snp-guest,id=sev0,cbitpos=51,reduced-phys-bits=1 \
  -object igvm-cfg,id=igvm0,file=$IGVM \
  -smp ${VCPU} \
  -no-reboot \
  -netdev user,id=vmnic -device e1000,netdev=vmnic,romfile= \
  -drive file=${BOOT_IMAGE},if=none,id=disk0,format=raw,snapshot=off \
  -device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi0,disable-legacy=on,iommu_platform=on \
  -device scsi-hd,drive=disk0,bootindex=0 \
  -nographic
```

### 7. Remote Attestation of VM

Once the VM is up, perform remote attestation to verify its integrity. Use the following command:

```
docker run -it sbnb/remote-attestation remote-attestation.sh root@<vm-ip>
```
Note: If you're interested, check out this [link](https://github.com/sbnb-io/sbnb/tree/main/containers/remote-attestation) to the container referenced in the command above.
It simplifies the remote attestation process for Confidential Computing (CC) VMs.

Example output for successful attestation:

![Confidential Computing (CC) SEV-SNP is attested](images/remote-attestation.png)

Below is the same output, duplicated as text for reference.

```

The remote Confidential Computing VM has successfully passed AMD SEV-SNP and vTPM attestation.

```

Warning! If the attestation fails or shows different output, **do not proceed** with using the VM, as it may have been tampered with.

### Congratulations!
You now have a secure, remotely attested Confidential Computing VM ready for sensitive workloads.
